    <!-- Similar to meter element, but shows in a different bar and I think 0 is the default min -->
    <!-- However, still shows a visual bar that shows 70/100 -->
    <!-- Like meter this is not always supported in other browers which is the purpose of the message -->
    <progress value="70" max="100">Your browser does not support progress element!</progress>
